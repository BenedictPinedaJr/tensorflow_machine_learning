# TensorFlow Machine Learning

**Follow instructions on how to setup TensorFlow on local device with access to GPU: https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip**

***Miniconda* must be installed in your unix environment**

***For local development, make sure to have NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit and NVIDIA cuDNN installed in your system (NVIDIA developer account required for cuDNN)***

## 1. Always activate the "conda" environment first before using the notebooks by using `conda activate tf`

## 2. Install packages to local device with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## 3. Set the notebooks to use the `tf` kernel

## *If there are new depencies installed, use the following command to store the dependecies to the list: `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
